# What needs to be done

- implement compliance checks for containers using TwistLock tool
- limit resource usage with cgroups
- implement docker-bench-security
- using JFrog Artifactory for storing containers without JFrog Xray but rather have TwistLock implemented
- implement Traeffik Load Balancer on top for auto-scalling purposes
- Set up Monitoring for Vault using Telegraf, InfluxDB and/or Grafana
